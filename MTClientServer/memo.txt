currently changing the whole thing to use request::Transaction instead of Transaction struct

batcher should be finished, move to partial sequencer next

partial sequencer should be working now? need to fix merger next!

MANAGED TO USE CONF+DITIONAL VARIABLES TO SYNC PARTIAL SEQUENCER AND MERGER! work on merger round request next!

double check the insert logic with examples from the paper!

can play around with batcher and partial_sequencer's period

go make a map for each txn to its scc?

should be able to remove the complete sccs, need to deal with incomplete sccs (eg: outgoing edges)
